# README — Knowledge Series: GNU/Linux & FOSS

Welcome!

This page is a small contribution to spread awareness, education, and collaboration around FOSS — Free and Open Source Software and GNU/Linux.

 Why This Initiative?
- To inspire individuals and businesses to embrace FOSS.
- To share knowledge about open software, licenses, and community-driven development.
- To encourage collaborations that transform old ideas into new opportunities, without heavy investments.

 What is FOSS?
- Free: Freedom to use, study, modify, and share software.
- Open Source: Transparent source code for anyone to inspect, improve, and fix.

> FOSS = Freedom + Transparency + Community Collaboration

 A Small Thought:
> "Each idea you have could be the seed of a billion-dollar innovation.  
> Alone, it may stay a dream.  
> Together — through FOSS — it can become reality."
